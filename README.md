## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running
on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To build the project, the following prerequisites must be met:

- ToDo: Check the prerequisites
- Java JDK 1.8 or higher (e.g. [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/))
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) 3.x
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) 11

If you want to run the application using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), the environment is already set up with all dependencies for you. You only have to install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and follow the instruction in the [dedicated section](#execute-with-docker).

### Source code

Get a copy of the repository:

```bash
ToDo: git clone https://github.com/noi-techpark/project-name.git
```

Change directory:

```bash
ToDo: cd project-name/
```

### Execute without Docker

Copy the file `src/main/resources/application.properties` to `src/main/resources/application-local.properties` and adjust the variables that get their values from environment variables. You can take a look at the `.env.example` for some help.

Build the project:

```bash
mvn -Dspring.profiles.active=local clean install
```

Run external dependencies, such as the database:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dependencies.yml up --detach
```

Run the project:

```bash
mvn -Dspring.profiles.active=local spring-boot:run
```

The service will be available at localhost and your specified server port.

To execute the test you can run the following command:

```bash
mvn clean test
```

### Execute with Docker

Copy the file `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust the configuration parameters.

Then you can start the application using the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

The service will be available at localhost and your specified server port.

To execute the test you can run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm app mvn clean test
```

### Documentation

More documentation can be found at [https://opendatahub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html](https://opendatahub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

### Boilerplate

The project uses this boilerplate: [https://github.com/noi-techpark/java-boilerplate](https://github.com/noi-techpark/java-boilerplate).

### License

The code in this project is licensed under the GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3 license. See the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file for more information.

### REUSE

This project is [REUSE](https://reuse.software) compliant, more information about the usage of REUSE in NOI Techpark repositories can be found [here](https://github.com/noi-techpark/odh-docs/wiki/Guidelines-for-developers-and-licenses#guidelines-for-contributors-and-new-developers).

Since the CI for this project checks for REUSE compliance you might find it useful to use a pre-commit hook checking for REUSE compliance locally. The [pre-commit-config](.pre-commit-config.yaml) file in the repository root is already configured to check for REUSE compliance with help of the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) tool.

Install the tool by running:
```bash
pip install pre-commit
```
Then install the pre-commit hook via the config file by running:
```bash
pre-commit install
```
